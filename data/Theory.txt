The concept of equivalent equations'],['Equations with the same roots are called equivalent equations. Equivalent transformations are transformations that result in an equivalent equation from a given equation. 3x - 2 = 7 , 3x - 2 + 2 = 7 + 2 , 3x = 9 
The concept of the root of an equation'],['An equation is an equation in which an unknown number is denoted by a letter. The root of the equation is the number that, when inserted into the equation in the variable, gives a true numerical equality. 5x - 8 = 7 , 5x = 7 + 8 , x = 15 : 5 , x = 3
The concept of equation. Linear equation'],['If the equation contains one variable and we have to find all the values ​​of the variable with which the equality is true, then it is said that the given equation is an equation with one variable. For example, equality 2 + ( 3 - 1 ) = 4 is not an equation, but 2 + ( x - 1 ) = 4 is an equation whose root is 3. The values of the variable with which the equality is true are called the solutions or roots of the equation.
